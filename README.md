User guide:
After launching the program, the user is prompted to enter the name of a database they want to work with. If the name entered is not an existing database, a new database file will be created. After the database is selected, a textual interface (the main menu) appears that lists the available functions and gives the option to quit the program. Some of these functions generate html files as output. When this happens, the html filename appears in the format “QX.html” if it is the first time the function was run and “QX-n.html” otherwise where X is the question number and n is the number denoting the first available filename in the above format.
